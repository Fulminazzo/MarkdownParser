This guided is divided into many parts:
- in the **first** one, there is an overview for the correct way of **loading** and **using YAML configuration** files (**platform independent**);
- in the **second** one, you will learn how to properly use the [Manager type](/configuration/src/main/java/it/angrybear/managers/Manager.java), provided by **BearCommands**;
- in the **third** one, you will find a deeper look into [Savable objects](/configuration/src/main/java/it/angrybear/objects/Savable.java), a special type that **BearCommands** uses to load and save them.
